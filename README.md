## Aim:
The aim of this journal is to understand and implement basic arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations using C++ programming. This involves taking input from the user, performing the operations, and displaying the results in a clear and concise manner.

## Software Used:
- Dev c++

## Theory:
Arithmetic Operations:
Arithmetic operations are fundamental mathematical operations performed on numbers. The basic arithmetic operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
<br>Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
<br>Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
<br>Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
<br>Division (/): Divides the first number by the second (integer division).
<br>Modulus (%): Returns the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.

<br>Comparison Operations:
Comparison operations are used to compare two values. The result of a comparison is a boolean value (true or false).

<br>Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal.
<br>Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal.
<br>Greater than (>): Checks if the first value is greater than the second.
<br>Less than (<): Checks if the first value is less than the second.
<br>Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the first value is greater than or equal to the second.
<br>Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the first value is less than or equal to the second.

<br><br>Logical Operations:
Logical operations are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. The basic logical operations include AND, OR, and NOT.

<br>Logical AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
<br>Logical OR (||): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
<br>Logical NOT (!): Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand.
